In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

The website won't be very beautiful as I don't have any knowledge of CSS as of the moment of writing this. Tho, I will revist this project and style it with CSS while I've learned it.

By the end of this project, I would have demonstrated my knowleged of HTML and Github.
